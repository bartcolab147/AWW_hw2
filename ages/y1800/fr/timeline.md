      Amidst financial crisis and social unrest, the Estates-General convened in May 1789 for the first time since 1614. Representatives from the three Estates (clergy, nobility, and commoners) gathered to address France's problems but were immediately deadlocked over voting procedures.

      The Third Estate's demand for voting by population rather than by estate led to a stalemate and ultimately their breakaway to form the National Assembly.

      This act of defiance marked a turning point in the revolution, asserting the sovereignty of the people over the monarchy.
