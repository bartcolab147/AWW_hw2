    long_desc: |
      Following the French Revolution and the Execution of Louis XVI, Prussia declared war on the French First Republic. When Prussian troops attempted to invade France, they were beaten back and the Treaty of Basel (1795) ended the War of the First Coalition.

      In it, the First French Republic and Prussia had stipulated that the latter would ensure the Holy Roman Empire's neutrality in all the latter's territories north of the demarcation line of the River Main, including the British continental dominions of the Electorate of Hanover and the Duchies of Bremen-Verden.

      In the course of the War of the Second Coalition against France (1799–1802), Napoleon Bonaparte urged Prussia to occupy Hanover. In 1801, 24,000 Prussian soldiers invaded, surprising Hanover, which surrendered without a fight.

      In April 1801 the Prussian troops arrived in Bremen-Verden's capital Stade and stayed there until October that year.

      In July 1806, Napoleon formed the Confederation of the Rhine out of the many small German states which constituted the Rhineland and most other western parts of Germany. He amalgamated many of the smaller states into larger electorates, duchies, and kingdoms to make the governance of non-Prussian Germany smoother.

      Napoleon elevated the rulers of the two largest Confederation states, Saxony and Bavaria, to the status of kings.

      Concerned about increasing French power, Prussia led the creation of the Fourth Coalition, which resumed war in October 1806. On October 8, 1806, Napoleon unleashed all the French forces east of the Rhine into Prussia.

      Napoleon defeated a Prussian army at Jena (14 October 1806), and Davout defeated another at Auerstädt on the same day.

    long_desc: |
      After the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt, Napoleon had taken only 19 days from beginning his attack on Prussia to knock it out of the war with the capture of Berlin and the destruction of its principal armies.

      At the Treaties of Tilsit in 1807, Prussia lost about half of its territory, and the remainder of the kingdom was occupied by French troops.

    long_desc: |
      Napoleon's retreat from Moscow was the signal for a rising against the French. The Prussian army, with Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher and August Neidhardt von Gneisenau as its leaders, took a major part in the Battle of Leipzig, in the campaign of 1814 in France, and in the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.

      Hardenberg adroitly steered Prussia through the difficulties of 1812, when Prussia and Austria, in enforced alliance with France, participated in Napoleon’s attack on Russia.

    short_desc: Congress of Vienna
    long_desc: |
      Prussia's reward for its part in France's defeat came at the Congress of Vienna (1814-1815). The objective of the Congress was to provide a long-term peace plan for Europe by settling critical issues arising from the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars through negotiation.

      Prussia regained most of its pre-1806 territory, with the exception of part of the territory annexed in the Second and Third Partitions of Poland, which became Congress Poland under Russian rule. As compensation it picked up some new territory, including 40% of the Kingdom of Saxony and much of Westphalia and the Rhineland.
