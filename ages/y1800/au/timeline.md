    short_desc: Francis II Becomes Emperor
    long_desc: |
      Francis II became the last Holy Roman Emperor in 1792 and later, in 1804, the first Emperor of Austria. His reign was largely defined by conflict with Revolutionary France and later Napoleon Bonaparte.

      Though well-intentioned, Francis was often overshadowed by more capable figures like Archduke Charles and Klemens von Metternich, particularly in matters of military and foreign policy.

    short_desc: Treaty of Campo Formio
    long_desc: |
      When a peace treaty was concluded at Campo Formio in 1797, France had conquered all lands west of the Rhine, including the Austrian Netherlands. These losses were added by the remaining Austrian possessions in Italy.

      As a compensation for this, Austria was allowed to annex the Republic of Venice.

    short_desc: Battle of Austerlitz and Treaty of Pressburg
    long_desc: |
      In 1805, Napoleon surrounded an Austrian army at the city of Ulm, compelled it to surrender, and advanced to Vienna itself, which he took in November 1805. He then moved into Moravia, to Vienna’s northeast, where he met a remnant of the Austrian army and the oncoming Russians. He defeated both at the famous Battle of Austerlitz on December 2, 1805.

      Austria concluded peace immediately with the Treaty of Pressburg on December 26, 1805, while Russia continued the war. In this treaty Austria gave up Venice to Napoleon’s Italian kingdom, Tirol to Bavaria, and a number of other lands to Napoleon’s clients.

    short_desc: Battle of Wagram and Treaty of Schönbrunn
    long_desc: |
      Inspired by the popular resistance of the Spanish people to Napoleon, Stadion appealed to his own people in 1809 to go to war. The declaration came in April, and the French army occupied Vienna in May.

      However, on May 21–22, at Aspern, across the Danube from Vienna, Archduke Charles and the regular Austrian army inflicted the first defeat Napoleon was to suffer on the field of battle. They did not take advantage of it, however; Napoleon regrouped and defeated Archduke Charles in July in the Battle of Wagram, just a few miles from Aspern. At the Treaty of Schönbrunn (October 1809), the monarchy surrendered considerably more territory but at least remained in existence.

    short_desc: Austria Joins the Sixth Coalition
    long_desc: |
      After 1809, foreign policy and to some extent domestic policy passed into the hands of Klemens, Graf von Metternich who believed that the only hope for the continued existence of the monarchy was to seek accommodation with Napoleon. It was he who arranged the marriage of Marie-Louise, and it was he who convinced Francis to send troops to take part in Napoleon’s invasion of Russia in 1812.

      By 1813, Metternich had realized the inevitability of Napoleon's downfall and took Austria to war against France, joining the Sixth Coalition. Austria played a decisive part in the overthrow of Napoleon in the campaigns of 1813–14.

    short_desc: Congress of Vienna
    long_desc: |
      In September 1814 the congress (1814-1815) to conclude the quarter century of war gathered in Vienna under Metternich’s chairmanship. In terms of territory, Metternich gladly relinquished claims to the old Austrian Netherlands and the various Habsburg possessions in Germany for a consolidated monarchy at the center of Europe.

      Austria regained its lands on the Adriatic and in the area that is now Austria, which it had previously lost, and it won considerable territory in Italy, including Lombardy, Venetia, Tuscany, and Modena.

    short_desc: German Confederation Established
    long_desc: |
      Metternich had no intention of restoring the old Holy Roman Empire but wished to create instead a system that could defend itself against both France and Russia and keep Prussia under control. His solution was the German Confederation, a body comprising 35 states and 4 free cities, with Austria assuming the presidency.

      Such an institution, in Metternich’s eyes, would give Austria far more influence in Germany than it had had under the old Holy Roman Empire.
