    short_desc: Formation of the Protestant Union
    long_desc: |
      The Protestant Union, also known as the Evangelical Union, was a coalition of Protestant German states formed on May 14, 1608. It was created by Frederick IV, Elector Palatine, to defend the rights, land, and safety of each member.

      The Union included both Calvinist and Lutheran states and was formed following the reestablishment of Catholicism in Donauwörth and the Imperial Diet's decision that renewal of the Peace of Augsburg should be conditional upon the restoration of all church land appropriated since 1552.

    long_desc: |
      The Catholic League was a coalition of Catholic states of the Holy Roman Empire formed on July 10, 1609. It was created to act politically and negotiate issues with the Protestant Union and was subsequently concluded as a military alliance for the defense of the Catholic religion and peace within the Empire.

      The League was founded due to documented reasons with the *Kreuz- und Fahnengefecht* incident in Donauwörth and the Protestant Union forming in the same year to prevent a reformation in the Catholic state.

    long_desc: |
      The Defenestration of Prague occurred on May 23, 1618, when Protestant rebels threw two Catholic governors and their secretary from a window at Prague Castle. This event sparked the Bohemian revolt against the Habsburg emperor and marked the beginning of the Thirty Years' War.

      The defenestration was triggered by the halting of Protestant chapel construction by Roman Catholic officials. The act of throwing the officials out the window was seen as a violation of Protestant liberties guaranteed by the 1609 Letter of Majesty.

    long_desc: |
      The Bohemian phase (1618-1624) was the first phase of the Thirty Years' War, characterized by a revolt in Bohemia against Habsburg rule. Protestant Czech nobles rebelled against Ferdinand II and his Catholic governors, leading to widespread conflict.

      The Catholic League, led by Bavaria, supported the Emperor, while the Bohemian rebels sought alliances with other Protestant forces. The phase concluded with the Battle of White Mountain in 1620, where the Catholic forces decisively defeated the Bohemian rebels, leading to the re-establishment of Habsburg control.

      The Battle of White Mountain took place on November 8, 1620, near Prague, where the Catholic League forces defeated the Bohemian rebels. This battle was a significant victory for the Catholic League, enabling Emperor Ferdinand II to regain control over Bohemia.

      The battle resulted in the collapse of the Bohemian revolt and marked the end of the Bohemian phase of the Thirty Years' War. The victory allowed the Habsburgs to consolidate their power and suppress Protestantism in Bohemia.

    long_desc: |
      The Danish phase (1624-1629) of the Thirty Years' War involved the intervention of King Christian IV of Denmark to protect Protestantism and expand his influence in Northern Europe. However, his ambitions to control the Baltic Maritime Trade and expand political power led him to enter the war.

      The Danish forces faced defeats against the Catholic League, particularly at the Battle of Lutter in 1626, where more than half the Danish army was destroyed, and Denmark was ultimately forced to sue for peace at the Treaty of Lübeck.

    long_desc: |
      The Swedish phase (1630-1635) marked a major turning point in the Thirty Years' War with the intervention of Sweden under King Gustavus Adolphus. Gustavus Adolphus landed his army in Pomerania and aimed to protect Protestant territories within the Holy Roman Empire.

      Swedish-led armies drove back Catholic forces, regaining much of the lost Protestant territory, particularly at the Battle of Breitenfeld in 1631. Despite initial successes, the death of Gustavus Adolphus at the Battle of Lützen in 1632 shifted the dynamics of the war.

    long_desc: |
      The Battle of Lützen, fought on November 16, 1632, was one of the most important battles of the Thirty Years' War. Led by King Gustavus Adolphus, the allied army narrowly defeated the Imperial force, but both sides suffered heavy casualties.

      Gustavus Adolphus was killed during the battle, but the Swedes continued the war under Axel Oxenstierna's direction. The battle's outcome forced Wallenstein out of Saxony and cemented French leadership of the anti-Habsburg alliance.

    long_desc: |
      The French phase (1635-1648) saw France, though Roman Catholic, entering the Thirty Years' War on the side of the Protestants to counter the Habsburgs. France aimed to end the encirclement by Habsburg powers on its borders.

      Cardinal Richelieu's decision to engage directly against the Habsburgs led to initial military defeats, but the tide turned in 1640 with victories such as the siege and capture of Arras. The war continued until the Peace of Westphalia in 1648.

      The Battle of Rocroi, fought on May 19, 1643, was a major engagement of the Thirty Years' War. Led by the Duke of Enghien, the French army shattered the myth of invincibility of the Spanish Tercios, marking the beginning of French hegemony in Europe.

      The victory at Rocroi was symbolically important, bolstering the reign of the new French king, Louis XIV. It also established Enghien's reputation, leading to his later victories and the name "the Great Condé".

    short_desc: Peace of Westphalia
    long_desc: |
      The Peace of Westphalia, signed in 1648, comprised European settlements that ended the Thirty Years' War. The peace was negotiated in the Westphalian towns of Münster and Osnabrück, with treaties signed between Spain and the Dutch and between Emperor Ferdinand III, German princes, France, and Sweden.

      The settlements resulted in territorial changes favoring Sweden, France, and their allies and confirmed independence for the United Provinces of the Netherlands and the Swiss Confederation. The treaties also recognized German princes as absolute sovereigns, weakening the Holy Roman Empire's central authority and laying the foundation for the modern state system and territorial sovereignty.
