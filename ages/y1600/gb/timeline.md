      The Short Parliament was summoned by King Charles I on 20 February 1640 and convened from 13 April to 5 May 1640. It was called "short" because it lasted only three weeks.

      Charles I called the Parliament to secure funds for his military conflict with Scotland during the Bishops' Wars, but the Parliament focused more on addressing grievances than granting the King funds.
