    short_desc: Beginning of Ottoman-Safavid War
    long_desc: |
      The Ottoman-Safavid War was a series of conflicts between the Ottoman Empire and the Safavid Empire. The Ottomans lost all the lands they had gained under the Treaty of Ferhat Pasha.

      The war ended with the Treaty of Serav in 1618, which acknowledged the losses suffered by the Ottomans. This conflict highlighted the ongoing struggle between the two empires for control over key territories in the Caucasus and Mesopotamia.

    short_desc: Regicide of Osman II
    long_desc: |
      Osman II was killed on May 20, 1622, by the imperial army, marking a turning point in the nature of the Ottoman Empire. The legally approved regicide of a reigning Ottoman monarch cemented the empire's transformation from a patrimonial empire into one in which power was shared between various loci of authority.

      Osman II's death was caused by the Janissaries, who revolted against him.

      During his brief majority reign, Murad IV (1623–1640) reasserted central authority and recaptured Iraq (1639) from the Safavids. Murad IV managed to restore central authority and military prowess to the Empire.

      The Treaty of Zuhab of that same year decisively divided the Caucasus and adjacent regions between the two neighboring empires as it had already been defined in the 1555 Peace of Amasya.

    short_desc: Conquest of Crete
    long_desc: |
      From 1645 onward the Ottomans were preoccupied with the difficult conquest of Crete from the Republic of Venice. The island was quickly overrun, but Venetian naval superiority enabled the fortress of Candia (modern Heraklion) to resist for decades.

      The conquest of Crete was finally completed in 1669 with the fall of Candia.

    short_desc: Köprülü Era
    long_desc: |
      During the Köprülü era (1656–1703), effective control of the Empire was exercised by a sequence of grand viziers from the Köprülü family. The Köprülü Vizierate saw renewed military success with authority restored in Transylvania.

      The Köprülü family helped regain the expansion into Polish southern Ukraine, with the strongholds of Khotyn, and Kamianets-Podilskyi and the territory of Podolia ceding to Ottoman control in 1676.

    short_desc: Battle of Vienna
    long_desc: |
      This period of renewed assertiveness came to a calamitous end in 1683 when Grand Vizier Kara Mustafa Pasha led a huge army to attempt a second Ottoman siege of Vienna in the Great Turkish War of 1683–1699. The final assault being fatally delayed, the Ottoman forces were swept away by allied Habsburg, German, and Polish forces spearheaded by the Polish king John III Sobieski at the Battle of Vienna.

      The Ottoman defeat at Vienna marked a turning point in the balance of power in Europe, signaling the beginning of the decline of Ottoman influence in the region.

      The Ottomans ceded most of Hungary to Austria in the Treaty of Karlowitz.
