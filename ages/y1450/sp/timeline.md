    short_desc: Marriage of Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon
    long_desc: |
      Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon married on October 19, 1469, laying the foundation for the unification of the kingdoms of Castile and Aragon into Spain. This union was a pivotal moment, bringing together two of the most powerful Christian kingdoms in the Iberian Peninsula.

      While the marriage united the crowns, each region retained its own political and judicial structure, so it was a union in title only. Isabella held more authority over the newly unified Spain than her husband, although their rule was shared.

      The expulsion had a significant impact on Spain's economy and society, as many Jews were skilled professionals and merchants. Islamic motifs remained popular, however, and were incorporated with Northern elements into a Gothic style.
