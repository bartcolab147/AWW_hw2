    short_desc: End of the Hundred Years' War
    long_desc: |
      The Hundred Years' War, a protracted conflict between England and France, finally concluded in 1453, marking a significant turning point in the histories of both nations. While the war had ebbed and flowed over the course of more than a century, the final years saw a resurgence of French power, culminating in the decisive Battle of Castillon. This battle, fought in southwestern France, resulted in a crushing defeat for the English forces, effectively ending their claims to vast territories on the continent.

      The conclusion of the Hundred Years' War had a profound impact on England, as it signaled the end of its long-held ambitions of carving out a continental empire. The loss of these territories forced the English monarchy to refocus its attention on domestic affairs, setting the stage for the tumultuous Wars of the Roses and the reshaping of the English political landscape.

    short_desc: Beginning of the Wars of the Roses
    long_desc: |
      The Wars of the Roses, a series of dynastic conflicts for the throne of England, erupted in 1455, plunging the country into decades of internal strife and bloodshed. This brutal struggle pitted the House of York, symbolized by the white rose, against the House of Lancaster, represented by the red rose, in a fierce competition for power. Both houses were descended from King Edward III, and their rivalry stemmed from competing claims to the English throne.

      The Wars of the Roses were characterized by shifting alliances, treachery, and brutal battles, leaving a lasting scar on the English aristocracy and society. The conflict was not merely a power struggle between noble families; it also reflected deeper tensions within English society, including economic grievances, regional rivalries, and the lingering effects of the Hundred Years' War. The wars were fought by retainers from private armies as the feudal levy was replaced by taxation.

    short_desc: Temporary End to the Wars of the Roses
    long_desc: |
      After years of intermittent fighting and shifting fortunes, the Wars of the Roses reached a temporary lull in 1471, following a decisive victory for the House of York. The Lancastrian forces, weakened by internal divisions and battlefield defeats, suffered a major setback with the deaths of key figures, including King Henry VI and his son, Edward of Westminster. This cleared the path for Edward IV, the Yorkist claimant, to consolidate his hold on the throne and restore a semblance of order to the war-torn kingdom.

      However, the peace was fragile, as the underlying tensions and rivalries that had fueled the conflict remained unresolved. While Edward IV's strong leadership and efforts at reconciliation brought a period of relative stability, the seeds of future conflict were already sown, threatening to reignite the Wars of the Roses in the years to come. Edward IV was born to parents Richard of York and Cecily Neville.

      The death of Edward IV in 1483 plunged England back into turmoil, as his young son, Edward V, was deemed too young to rule.

      Despite Henry VII's victory at Bosworth Field and his efforts to consolidate his rule, the Yorkist faction refused to accept his legitimacy, leading to a series of rebellions and conspiracies aimed at unseating the new king. One of the most significant of these challenges was the Lambert Simnel rebellion, which erupted in 1487. Lambert Simnel, a young boy, was presented as Edward, Earl of Warwick, a Yorkist claimant who was actually imprisoned in the Tower of London.

      The rebellion gained support from Yorkist sympathizers in England and abroad, including Margaret of Burgundy, the sister of Richard III, who provided financial and military assistance. The decisive engagement was the Battle of Stoke. An attempt by Yorkists to unseat Henry VII was defeated.

    short_desc: Act of Supremacy
    long_desc: |
      Henry VIII's desire for a male heir and his frustration with the Catholic Church's refusal to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon led to a seismic shift in English history. In 1534, Henry VIII declared himself the Supreme Head of the Church of England, severing ties with Rome and establishing the English monarchy as the ultimate authority in religious matters.

      The Act of Supremacy not only granted Henry VIII the power to control religious doctrine and appointments but also paved the way for the Dissolution of the Monasteries and the seizure of Church wealth. This was caused by the divorce crisis of Henry VIII. The Act of Supremacy led to significant religious and political changes in England, leading to instability.
