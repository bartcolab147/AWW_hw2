    short_desc: War of the Spanish Succession
    long_desc: |
      The War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1714) resulted in a significant expansion of Austria's territory, even though Austria had rejected partition treaties previously. Large parts of modern Belgium and Italy came under Vienna's rule as a result of the war.

      The main claimants to the Spanish realm were France and Austria. Carlos II bequeathed his kingdoms to French king Louis XIV's younger grandson, igniting the war.

    short_desc: Austro-Turkish War
    long_desc: |
      A Turkish attempt to reconquer territory lost to Venice triggered an Austrian declaration of war in 1715. In the following peace treaty from 1718, Austria was enlarged with the remaining parts of Hungary and adjacent territories.

      Austria had now reached its largest extent ever as a result of this expansion.

      A Spanish attempt to reconquer their lost Italian possessions failed, but resulted in Austria exchanging Sardinia with Sicily from the duke of Savoy.

    long_desc: |
      The monarchy wrested the province of Bukovina from the Turks, following the initiative of Joseph II, Maria Theresa’s son. The province served as a convenient connection between Galicia and Transylvania.

      Joseph II had succeeded his father as Holy Roman Emperor in 1765 and shared power with his mother Maria Theresia until her death in 1780.

    short_desc: War of the Bavarian Succession
    long_desc: |
      One of Kaunitz’s initiatives, to trade the distant Austrian Netherlands for nearby Bavaria, led to a third war with Prussia. However, the War of the Bavarian Succession (1778-1779) featured virtually no military contact between the two powers.

      Maria Theresa intervened directly with her old enemy Frederick II and concluded with him the Treaty of Teschen. The treaty resulted in a few minor territorial adjustments, especially the addition of Bavarian territories east of the Inn River to Upper Austria, but above all in the canceling of the proposed swap of the Austrian Netherlands for Bavaria.
