      France was deeply involved in the War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1714), triggered by Louis XIV's grandson inheriting the Spanish throne. This move threatened the balance of power in Europe, leading to a coalition against France.

      Despite initial successes, France faced defeats and ultimately had to accept terms in the Treaty of Utrecht (1713) that prevented the unification of the French and Spanish crowns.

      France ceded territories in North America to Britain, marking a shift in colonial power. The treaty signaled the end of French hegemony in Europe and the rise of Great Britain as a major power.
