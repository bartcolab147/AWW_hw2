    long_desc: |
      On January 18, 1701, Elector Frederick III elevated Prussia from a duchy to a kingdom and crowned himself King Frederick I. Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I only allowed Frederick to title himself "King *in* Prussia", not "King *of* Prussia".

      The state of Brandenburg-Prussia became commonly known as "Prussia," though most of its territory lay outside Prussia proper. Frederick I sponsored the arts at the expense of the treasury, causing the Prussian state to grow.

      Prussia joined the coalition against the Swedish Empire in the Great Northern War in 1715, under Frederick William. Prussia participated in only one battle, the Battle of Stresow, but gained all of Swedish Pomerania east of the River Oder in the Treaty of Stockholm.

      The Great Northern War marked the end of the Swedish Empire and elevated Prussia and Russia as new powers in Europe at the expense of the declining Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.

    long_desc: |
      The First Silesian War began with a Prussian invasion of Habsburg Silesia in December 1740. Frederick moved his troops across the frontier without a declaration of war.

      The war ended in 1742 with the Treaty of Berlin, recognizing Prussian control of Silesia. Silesia became a vital region to Prussia, greatly increasing the nation's area, population, and wealth.

    long_desc: |
      During the Seven Years' War (1756-1763), Prussia faced Austria, Russia, France, and Sweden simultaneously. Frederick managed to prevent a serious invasion until October 1760, when the Russian army briefly occupied Berlin and KÃ¶nigsberg.

      The situation became progressively grimmer until the death in 1762 of Empress Elizabeth of Russia. After the Battle of Burkersdorf, Prussia was able to force a *status quo ante bellum* on the continent.

    short_desc: First Partition of Poland
    long_desc: |
      Frederick was instrumental in initiating the first of the Partitions of Poland between Russia, Prussia, and Austria in 1772 to maintain a balance of power. The Kingdom of Prussia annexed most of the Polish province of Royal Prussia, allowing Frederick to finally adopt the title King *of* Prussia.

      The annexed territory connected East Prussia with the Province of Pomerania, uniting the kingdom's eastern territories.

    short_desc: Prussian Law Code
    long_desc: |
      After Frederick's death, the reform was completed, resulting in the Prussian Law Code of 1794, which balanced absolutism with human rights and corporate privilege with equality before the law. Reception to the law code was mixed as it was often viewed as contradictory.

      Frederick understood himself as the "first servant of the state" and promoted the development of Prussian areas. He also opened Prussia's borders to immigrants fleeing from religious persecution in other parts of Europe.
