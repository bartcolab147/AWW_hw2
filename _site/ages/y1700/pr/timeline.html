            <p class="p-1">Welcome to our site on Prussia's history, a powerful German state centered on the North European Plain. From its origins in 1525 to its key role in German unification, Prussia's militaristic society and influential leaders shaped the course of European history.

          <p class="my-5">Prussia originated from the secularization of the Prussian part of the State of the Teutonic Order in 1525. The union of Brandenburg and Prussia formed Brandenburg-Prussia, consisting of geographically disconnected territories. Under leaders like Frederick William I, Prussia developed a powerful military and an absolute monarchy. In 1701, it became the Kingdom of Prussia, rising to become a major European power. Prussia played a key role in German unification during the 19th century under Otto von Bismarck, but its separate existence ended after World War II when its territory was divided among East Germany, Poland, and the Soviet Union.

The state of Brandenburg-Prussia became commonly known as "Prussia," though most of its territory lay outside Prussia proper. Frederick I sponsored the arts at the expense of the treasury, causing the Prussian state to grow.

The Great Northern War marked the end of the Swedish Empire and elevated Prussia and Russia as new powers in Europe at the expense of the declining Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.

The war ended in 1742 with the Treaty of Berlin, recognizing Prussian control of Silesia. Silesia became a vital region to Prussia, greatly increasing the nation's area, population, and wealth.

The situation became progressively grimmer until the death in 1762 of Empress Elizabeth of Russia. After the Battle of Burkersdorf, Prussia was able to force a *status quo ante bellum* on the continent.

Reception to the law code was mixed as it was often viewed as contradictory.

Frederick understood himself as the "first servant of the state" and promoted the development of Prussian areas. He also opened Prussia's borders to immigrants fleeing from religious persecution in other parts of Europe.
