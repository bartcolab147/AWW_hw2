            <p class="p-1">Welcome to our site on the history of the Russian Empire, a vast state that spanned northern Eurasia from 1721 to 1917. From its proclamation by Peter the Great to the Russian Revolution, explore its territorial expansion, cultural shifts, and political developments.</p>
          </summary>
          <p class="my-5">The Russian Empire was proclaimed in November 1721 by Peter the Great, transforming the Tsardom of Russia after the Great Northern War. Peter initiated Western-oriented reforms, moving the capital to Saint Petersburg and modernizing the state. The empire expanded under rulers like Catherine the Great and Alexander I, becoming a major European power. Despite reforms, it faced internal tensions, leading to the 1905 Revolution and the establishment of the State Duma. Involvement in World War I led to the February Revolution in 1917, the abdication of Nicholas II, and ultimately the rise of the Bolsheviks.</p>

Russia was the main benefactor under the agreement as Sweden formally recognised Russia’s claim to the whole of Ingria, Estonia and Livonia, plus Priozersk and Vyborg.

Following the treaty and the incorporation of the new territories, Peter proclaimed the beginning of the Russian Empire and he adopted the title of emperor rather than tsar, although the word ‘tsar’ is still commonly used to refer to the ruler of the Russian Empire.

                  <p class="m-2 text-gray-600">The Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774) ended with the signing of the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca on July 21, 1774. The portion of the Yedisan region east of the Southern Bug river, the Kabarda region in the Caucasus, and several Crimean ports, went to Russia.

The Crimean Khanate received independence from the Ottoman Empire, which also declared Russia the protector of Christians on its territory.
