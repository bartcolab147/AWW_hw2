            <p class="p-1">Welcome to our site on French history, where you can explore the rich and diverse past of one of Europe's most influential nations. From the ancient Gauls to the modern Fifth Republic, France has been shaped by pivotal events such as the French Revolution, the rise and fall of empires, and significant roles in both World Wars. Discover how these historical milestones have contributed to the France we know today.</p>
          </summary>
          <p class="my-5">French history is a rich tapestry of political, cultural, and social evolution. It begins with the ancient Gauls and their conquest by the Romans, who left a lasting legacy in language and law. The Kingdom of France emerged in the 9th century, with significant events like the Hundred Years War and the rise of Joan of Arc shaping French identity.<br>
The Renaissance saw France become a centralized monarchy under the Bourbons, marked by religious conflicts and the eventual Edict of Nantes. The French Revolution in 1789 ended the monarchy, leading to the Reign of Terror and the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte, who expanded French influence across Europe.<br>
Modern France has been shaped by its role in World War II, transitioning from the Fourth to the Fifth Republic under Charles de Gaulle in 1958. Today, France is a major economic and cultural power, deeply involved in European integration. Explore our site to learn more about these pivotal moments and figures that have defined French history.</p>

                  <p class="m-2 text-gray-600">Amidst financial crisis and social unrest, the Estates-General convened in May 1789 for the first time since 1614. Representatives from the three Estates (clergy, nobility, and commoners) gathered to address France's problems but were immediately deadlocked over voting procedures.

The Third Estate's demand for voting by population rather than by estate led to a stalemate and ultimately their breakaway to form the National Assembly.

                  <p class="m-2 text-gray-600">Frustrated by the lack of progress, the Third Estate declared itself the National Assembly in June 1789. Locked out of their meeting hall, members of the Assembly gathered at a nearby tennis court and swore the Tennis Court Oath, pledging not to disband until they had written a new constitution for France.

This act of defiance marked a turning point in the revolution, asserting the sovereignty of the people over the monarchy.

This event, triggered by rumors of royal troops gathering to suppress the National Assembly, symbolized the people's uprising against royal authority.

The storming of the Bastille became a pivotal moment and a symbol of the French Revolution, sparking uprisings throughout France.
