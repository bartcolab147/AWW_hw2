          <p class="my-5">Prussia originated from the secularization of the Prussian part of the State of the Teutonic Order in 1525. The union of Brandenburg and Prussia formed Brandenburg-Prussia, consisting of geographically disconnected territories. Under leaders like Frederick William I, Prussia developed a powerful military and an absolute monarchy. In 1701, it became the Kingdom of Prussia, rising to become a major European power. Prussia played a key role in German unification during the 19th century under Otto von Bismarck, but its separate existence ended after World War II when its territory was divided among East Germany, Poland, and the Soviet Union.

In it, the First French Republic and Prussia had stipulated that the latter would ensure the Holy Roman Empire's neutrality in all the latter's territories north of the demarcation line of the River Main, including the British continental dominions of the Electorate of Hanover and the Duchies of Bremen-Verden.

In April 1801 the Prussian troops arrived in Bremen-Verden's capital Stade and stayed there until October that year.

He amalgamated many of the smaller states into larger electorates, duchies, and kingdoms to make the governance of non-Prussian Germany smoother.

Napoleon elevated the rulers of the two largest Confederation states, Saxony and Bavaria, to the status of kings.

The Prussian army, with Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher and August Neidhardt von Gneisenau as its leaders, took a major part in the Battle of Leipzig, in the campaign of 1814 in France, and in the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.

Hardenberg adroitly steered Prussia through the difficulties of 1812, when Prussia and Austria, in enforced alliance with France, participated in Napoleon’s attack on Russia.

                  <p class="m-2 text-gray-600">Prussia's reward for its part in France's defeat came at the Congress of Vienna (1814-1815). The objective of the Congress was to provide a long-term peace plan for Europe by settling critical issues arising from the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars through negotiation.

Prussia regained most of its pre-1806 territory, with the exception of part of the territory annexed in the Second and Third Partitions of Poland, which became Congress Poland under Russian rule. As compensation it picked up some new territory, including 40% of the Kingdom of Saxony and much of Westphalia and the Rhineland.
