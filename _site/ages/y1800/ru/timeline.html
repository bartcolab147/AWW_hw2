            <p class="p-1">Welcome to our site on the history of the Russian Empire, a vast state that spanned northern Eurasia from 1721 to 1917. From its proclamation by Peter the Great to the Russian Revolution, explore its territorial expansion, cultural shifts, and political developments.</p>
          </summary>
          <p class="my-5">The Russian Empire was proclaimed in November 1721 by Peter the Great, transforming the Tsardom of Russia after the Great Northern War. Peter initiated Western-oriented reforms, moving the capital to Saint Petersburg and modernizing the state. The empire expanded under rulers like Catherine the Great and Alexander I, becoming a major European power. Despite reforms, it faced internal tensions, leading to the 1905 Revolution and the establishment of the State Duma. Involvement in World War I led to the February Revolution in 1917, the abdication of Nicholas II, and ultimately the rise of the Bolsheviks.</p>

Paul's policies, including restrictions on travel and censorship, made him unpopular with the Russian nobility, who had enjoyed considerable freedoms under Catherine.

                  <p class="m-2 text-gray-600">Russia was a major player at the Congress of Vienna (1814-1815), which aimed to reorganize Europe after Napoleon's defeat. Tsar Alexander I played a key role in shaping the post-war order.

Russia gained territory, including most of the Duchy of Warsaw, which was reorganized into Congress Poland under Russian sovereignty. The Congress of Vienna established a new balance of power in Europe.
