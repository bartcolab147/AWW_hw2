            <p class="p-1">Welcome to our site on French history, where you can explore the rich and diverse past of one of Europe's most influential nations. From the ancient Gauls to the modern Fifth Republic, France has been shaped by pivotal events such as the French Revolution, the rise and fall of empires, and significant roles in both World Wars. Discover how these historical milestones have contributed to the France we know today.</p>
          </summary>
          <p class="my-5">French history is a rich tapestry of political, cultural, and social evolution. It begins with the ancient Gauls and their conquest by the Romans, who left a lasting legacy in language and law. The Kingdom of France emerged in the 9th century, with significant events like the Hundred Years War and the rise of Joan of Arc shaping French identity.<br>
The Renaissance saw France become a centralized monarchy under the Bourbons, marked by religious conflicts and the eventual Edict of Nantes. The French Revolution in 1789 ended the monarchy, leading to the Reign of Terror and the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte, who expanded French influence across Europe.<br>
Modern France has been shaped by its role in World War II, transitioning from the Fourth to the Fifth Republic under Charles de Gaulle in 1958. Today, France is a major economic and cultural power, deeply involved in European integration. Explore our site to learn more about these pivotal moments and figures that have defined French history.</p>

                  <p class="m-2 text-gray-600">The Battle of Agincourt, a major loss for the French in the Hundred Years' War (1415–1429), took place on October 25, 1415. An English army under King Henry V landed in the north of France and dealt a crushing defeat to French forces.

By the 1420s, England possessed most of France north of the Loire River, and the English king Henry V was named heir to the throne.

The wars continued until 1559 and were a crucial factor in introducing the French to Italian Renaissance ideas, which were brought back to France and epitomized in the celebrated court of François I (r. 1515–47).

Francis I created a more unified French state in part by reducing regional autonomy.

                  <p class="m-2 text-gray-600">A Franco-Ottoman fleet captured the city of Nice in August 1543 and laid siege to the citadel, which was relieved within a month. The French, under François, Count d'Enghien, defeated an Imperial army at the Battle of Ceresole in 1544, but the French failed to penetrate further into Lombardy.

Charles and Henry VIII of England then proceeded to invade northern France, seizing Boulogne and Soissons. A lack of cooperation between the Spanish and English armies, coupled with increasingly aggressive Ottoman attacks, led Charles to abandon these conquests, restoring the status quo once again.

France was deeply affected by the Protestant Reformation's attempt to break the unity of Roman Catholic Europe.
