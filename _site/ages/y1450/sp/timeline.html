            <p class="p-1">Welcome to our site on Spain's history, a nation shaped by its location on the Iberian Peninsula and its rich cultural heritage. From ancient civilizations to its role in global exploration and empire-building, Spain's story is filled with pivotal events. Discover how these milestones have contributed to the Spain we know today.

          <p class="my-5">The history of Spain dates back to the pre-Roman peoples of the Mediterranean coast of the Iberian Peninsula. Over time, Greeks, Carthaginians, and Romans colonized the peninsula, which the Romans called Hispania. Germanic tribes invaded in the 4th and 5th centuries AD, ending Roman rule. In 711, the Umayyad Caliphate conquered most of the region, which became known as Al-Andalus. Christian kingdoms in the north gradually expanded their control, starting the Reconquista. The marriage of Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon in 1469 unified the crowns, laying the foundation for modern Spain. 1492 was a pivotal year, marked by the conquest of Granada and Christopher Columbus's voyage to the New World. Spain then began building a vast overseas empire in the Americas.

This union was a pivotal moment, bringing together two of the most powerful Christian kingdoms in the Iberian Peninsula.

While the marriage united the crowns, each region retained its own political and judicial structure, so it was a union in title only. Isabella held more authority over the newly unified Spain than her husband, although their rule was shared.

Isabella's claim to the throne was supported by the Kingdom of Aragon and by the Castilian nobility. Her reign was marked by efforts to consolidate royal power and reform the administration of Castile.

                  <p class="m-2 text-gray-600">In 1492, the Alhambra Decree ordered the expulsion of Jews from Spain. This decision was driven by religious intolerance and a desire to create a homogenous Christian state.

The expulsion had a significant impact on Spain's economy and society, as many Jews were skilled professionals and merchants. Islamic motifs remained popular, however, and were incorporated with Northern elements into a Gothic style.

Columbus's voyage opened a new chapter in world history and led to the establishment of the Spanish Empire in the Americas.

                  <p class="m-2 text-gray-600">The Treaty of Tordesillas was signed between Spain and Portugal, dividing the newly discovered lands outside of Europe between the two kingdoms. This treaty aimed to resolve disputes over colonial claims and prevent conflict between the two powers.

The treaty gave Spain rights to most of the Americas, while Portugal gained control over what is now Brazil, as well as territories in Africa and Asia. This rivalry with Portugal drove early expansion.
