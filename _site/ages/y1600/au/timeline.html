            <p class="p-1">Welcome to our site on Austrian history, where you can explore the rich and diverse past of one of Europe's most influential nations. From the ancient Celtic tribes to the modern Second Republic, Austria has been shaped by pivotal events such as the rise of the Habsburgs, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and significant roles in both World Wars. Discover how these historical milestones have contributed to the Austria we know today.

          <p class="my-5">Austrian history is a complex tapestry of political, cultural, and social evolution. It begins with the ancient Celtic tribes and their influence on the region, followed by Roman rule and later the establishment of the Duchy of Austria in the 12th century. The Habsburgs dominated Austria from the late 13th century, shaping the country into a major imperial power. The Austro-Hungarian Empire was formed in 1867, but it collapsed after World War I, leading to the establishment of the First Republic. The interwar period saw the rise of Austrofascism and the eventual annexation by Nazi Germany in 1938. After World War II, Austria became an independent republic again in 1955 and has since been a neutral country, joining the European Union in 1995.

                  <p class="m-2 text-gray-600">The Protestant Union, also known as the Evangelical Union, was a coalition of Protestant German states formed on May 14, 1608. It was created by Frederick IV, Elector Palatine, to defend the rights, land, and safety of each member.

The Union included both Calvinist and Lutheran states and was formed following the reestablishment of Catholicism in Donauwörth and the Imperial Diet's decision that renewal of the Peace of Augsburg should be conditional upon the restoration of all church land appropriated since 1552.

                  <p class="m-2 text-gray-600">The Catholic League was a coalition of Catholic states of the Holy Roman Empire formed on July 10, 1609. It was created to act politically and negotiate issues with the Protestant Union and was subsequently concluded as a military alliance for the defense of the Catholic religion and peace within the Empire.

The League was founded due to documented reasons with the *Kreuz- und Fahnengefecht* incident in Donauwörth and the Protestant Union forming in the same year to prevent a reformation in the Catholic state.

                  <p class="m-2 text-gray-600">The Defenestration of Prague occurred on May 23, 1618, when Protestant rebels threw two Catholic governors and their secretary from a window at Prague Castle. This event sparked the Bohemian revolt against the Habsburg emperor and marked the beginning of the Thirty Years' War.

The defenestration was triggered by the halting of Protestant chapel construction by Roman Catholic officials. The act of throwing the officials out the window was seen as a violation of Protestant liberties guaranteed by the 1609 Letter of Majesty.

                  <p class="m-2 text-gray-600">The Bohemian phase (1618-1624) was the first phase of the Thirty Years' War, characterized by a revolt in Bohemia against Habsburg rule. Protestant Czech nobles rebelled against Ferdinand II and his Catholic governors, leading to widespread conflict.

The Catholic League, led by Bavaria, supported the Emperor, while the Bohemian rebels sought alliances with other Protestant forces. The phase concluded with the Battle of White Mountain in 1620, where the Catholic forces decisively defeated the Bohemian rebels, leading to the re-establishment of Habsburg control.

                  <p class="m-2 text-gray-600">The Danish phase (1624-1629) of the Thirty Years' War involved the intervention of King Christian IV of Denmark to protect Protestantism and expand his influence in Northern Europe. However, his ambitions to control the Baltic Maritime Trade and expand political power led him to enter the war.

The Danish forces faced defeats against the Catholic League, particularly at the Battle of Lutter in 1626, where more than half the Danish army was destroyed, and Denmark was ultimately forced to sue for peace at the Treaty of Lübeck.

                  <p class="m-2 text-gray-600">The Swedish phase (1630-1635) marked a major turning point in the Thirty Years' War with the intervention of Sweden under King Gustavus Adolphus. Gustavus Adolphus landed his army in Pomerania and aimed to protect Protestant territories within the Holy Roman Empire.

Swedish-led armies drove back Catholic forces, regaining much of the lost Protestant territory, particularly at the Battle of Breitenfeld in 1631. Despite initial successes, the death of Gustavus Adolphus at the Battle of Lützen in 1632 shifted the dynamics of the war.

Gustavus Adolphus was killed during the battle, but the Swedes continued the war under Axel Oxenstierna's direction. The battle's outcome forced Wallenstein out of Saxony and cemented French leadership of the anti-Habsburg alliance.

Cardinal Richelieu's decision to engage directly against the Habsburgs led to initial military defeats, but the tide turned in 1640 with victories such as the siege and capture of Arras. The war continued until the Peace of Westphalia in 1648.

                  <p class="m-2 text-gray-600">The Battle of Rocroi, fought on May 19, 1643, was a major engagement of the Thirty Years' War. Led by the Duke of Enghien, the French army shattered the myth of invincibility of the Spanish Tercios, marking the beginning of French hegemony in Europe.

The victory at Rocroi was symbolically important, bolstering the reign of the new French king, Louis XIV. It also established Enghien's reputation, leading to his later victories and the name "the Great Condé".

The peace was negotiated in the Westphalian towns of Münster and Osnabrück, with treaties signed between Spain and the Dutch and between Emperor Ferdinand III, German princes, France, and Sweden.

The settlements resulted in territorial changes favoring Sweden, France, and their allies and confirmed independence for the United Provinces of the Netherlands and the Swiss Confederation. The treaties also recognized German princes as absolute sovereigns, weakening the Holy Roman Empire's central authority and laying the foundation for the modern state system and territorial sovereignty.
