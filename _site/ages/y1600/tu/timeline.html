          <p class="my-5">Founded around 1299 by Osman I in Anatolia, the Ottoman Empire expanded through conquest, ending the Byzantine Empire with the capture of Constantinople in 1453. Under leaders like Mehmed II and Suleiman the Magnificent, the empire became a global power, controlling vital trade routes and diverse territories. The empire granted autonomy to various religious communities and saw its peak in the 16th and 17th centuries, but later faced internal stagnation and territorial losses. The Ottoman Empire dissolved after World War I, replaced by the Republic of Turkey in 1923.

The war ended with the Treaty of Serav in 1618, which acknowledged the losses suffered by the Ottomans. This conflict highlighted the ongoing struggle between the two empires for control over key territories in the Caucasus and Mesopotamia.

The legally approved regicide of a reigning Ottoman monarch cemented the empire's transformation from a patrimonial empire into one in which power was shared between various loci of authority.

Osman II's death was caused by the Janissaries, who revolted against him.

The Treaty of Zuhab of that same year decisively divided the Caucasus and adjacent regions between the two neighboring empires as it had already been defined in the 1555 Peace of Amasya.

The conquest of Crete was finally completed in 1669 with the fall of Candia.

The Köprülü family helped regain the expansion into Polish southern Ukraine, with the strongholds of Khotyn, and Kamianets-Podilskyi and the territory of Podolia ceding to Ottoman control in 1676.

                  <p class="m-2 text-gray-600">This period of renewed assertiveness came to a calamitous end in 1683 when Grand Vizier Kara Mustafa Pasha led a huge army to attempt a second Ottoman siege of Vienna in the Great Turkish War of 1683–1699. The final assault being fatally delayed, the Ottoman forces were swept away by allied Habsburg, German, and Polish forces spearheaded by the Polish king John III Sobieski at the Battle of Vienna.

The Ottoman defeat at Vienna marked a turning point in the balance of power in Europe, signaling the beginning of the decline of Ottoman influence in the region.

                  <p class="m-2 text-gray-600">The alliance of the Holy League pressed home the advantage of the defeat at Vienna, culminating in the Treaty of Karlowitz (26 January 1699), which ended the Great Turkish War. The Ottomans surrendered control of significant territories, many permanently.

The Ottomans ceded most of Hungary to Austria in the Treaty of Karlowitz.

                  <p class="m-2 text-gray-600">On July 3 (14), 1700, in Constantinople, Russia and Turkey concluded a peace treaty resulting from Azov campaigns of Peter I in 1695-1696. The treaty was signed by Russian envoy Yemelyan Ignatievich Ukraintsev and Turkish Grand Vizier Nikolai Mavrokordato.

Under the treaty, Russia received Azov along with the adjoining territory and restored fortresses, gaining access to the Azov Sea. The treaty, concluded for 30 years, was observed until November 1710, when Turkey declared war on Russia.
