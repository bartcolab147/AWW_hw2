            <p class="p-1">Welcome to our site on the history of Sweden, a nation with a rich past stretching back to the Stone Age. From its time as a Viking power to its modern-day neutrality, Sweden's story is one of transformation and innovation. Explore key events that have shaped this Scandinavian nation.
</p>
          </summary>
          <p class="my-5">The history of Sweden dates back to around 12,000 BC, following the retreat of the Northern Polar Ice Caps. Early inhabitants used stone tools for hunting and gathering. Swedish recorded history began in the late 10th century. Sweden, Denmark, and Norway formed the Kalmar Union in the late 14th century, but Sweden broke away in the early 16th century under Gustav Vasa, who established the Lutheran Church in Sweden. In the 17th century, Sweden became a major European power by gaining control over the Baltic region. Sweden's power declined in the 18th century, and it lost Finland to Russia in 1809. Since 1814, Sweden has maintained a policy of neutrality, and it joined NATO in March 2024.

                  <p class="m-2 text-gray-600">Gustavus Adolphus ascended to the throne in 1611 and is considered the founder of the Swedish Empire. His reign marked the beginning of Sweden's rise as a great European power, transforming the country into a dominant force in the Baltic region.

His military reforms and tactical innovations led to significant victories in the Thirty Years' War, establishing Sweden as a major Protestant power. He died in 1632 in the Battle of Lützen.

                  <p class="m-2 text-gray-600">Sweden's involvement in the Thirty Years' War, under Gustavus Adolphus, dramatically altered the balance of power in Europe. Swedish forces conquered approximately half of the member states of the Holy Roman Empire.

Despite early successes, setbacks such as the Battle of Nördlingen in 1634 shifted the fortunes of war, but with French intervention, Sweden ultimately emerged as one of the winners at the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, gaining significant territories.

                  <p class="m-2 text-gray-600">Sweden established a colony called New Sweden in the Delaware River valley in North America in 1638. This marked Sweden's foray into overseas colonization, seeking to expand its influence and trade networks across the Atlantic.

While relatively short-lived, the colony represented Sweden's ambition to participate in the competition for territories and resources in the New World.

Her abdication marked a turning point in Swedish history, leading to the ascension of Charles X Gustav and a shift in the country's political direction.

Denmark invaded Scania, triggering intense fighting between Swedes and Danes, with Scania divided into Danish and Swedish enclaves. The Treaty of Fontainebleau in 1679 restored Danish conquests to Sweden.

                  <p class="m-2 text-gray-600">The Great Northern War, beginning in 1700, marked the beginning of the end for the Swedish Empire. Alliances declared war on Sweden.

The defeat of Charles XII's army at the Battle of Poltava in 1709 signaled the decline of Sweden as a great power. The Treaty of Nystad in 1721 forced Sweden to cede territories to Russia, further diminishing its influence.
