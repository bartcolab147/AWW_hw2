            <p class="p-1">Welcome to our site on French history, where you can explore the rich and diverse past of one of Europe's most influential nations. From the ancient Gauls to the modern Fifth Republic, France has been shaped by pivotal events such as the French Revolution, the rise and fall of empires, and significant roles in both World Wars. Discover how these historical milestones have contributed to the France we know today.</p>
          </summary>
          <p class="my-5">French history is a rich tapestry of political, cultural, and social evolution. It begins with the ancient Gauls and their conquest by the Romans, who left a lasting legacy in language and law. The Kingdom of France emerged in the 9th century, with significant events like the Hundred Years War and the rise of Joan of Arc shaping French identity.<br>
The Renaissance saw France become a centralized monarchy under the Bourbons, marked by religious conflicts and the eventual Edict of Nantes. The French Revolution in 1789 ended the monarchy, leading to the Reign of Terror and the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte, who expanded French influence across Europe.<br>
Modern France has been shaped by its role in World War II, transitioning from the Fourth to the Fifth Republic under Charles de Gaulle in 1958. Today, France is a major economic and cultural power, deeply involved in European integration. Explore our site to learn more about these pivotal moments and figures that have defined French history.</p>

                  <p class="m-2 text-gray-600">Cardinal Armand Jean du Plessis de Richelieu served as the first minister of King Louis XIII (1624-1642), significantly shaping French and European history in the 17th century. He was one of the most powerful people of the 17th century, influencing both domestic and foreign policy.

Richelieu aimed to strengthen the authority and power of the king and defend the state against internal and external enemies. He wasn't a religious fanatic but saw the Huguenots as a dangerous political element destabilizing the country.

                  <p class="m-2 text-gray-600">The capture of La Rochelle occurred after a 14-month siege, ending on October 28, 1628. Cardinal Richelieu's army besieged La Rochelle, a Huguenot stronghold, with English support failing to break the French blockade.

During the siege of La Rochelle in 1627, Krzysztof Arciszewski proposed cutting off the city's sea supply with a dam, contributing to its fall. The city's surrender marked a significant victory for Louis XIII and Cardinal Richelieu against the Huguenots.

                  <p class="m-2 text-gray-600">In 1685, Louis XIV revoked the Edict of Nantes, which had guaranteed religious freedom to the Huguenots. This act forbade Protestant services and destroyed their temples, leading many Huguenots to convert or emigrate.

Louis XIV feared that the Huguenots would cause internal conflict and weaken France. The emigration of Huguenots led to a significant decline in the population and destabilized the economy.
