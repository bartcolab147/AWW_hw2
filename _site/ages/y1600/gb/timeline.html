          <p class="my-5">The history of Great Britain is a tale of invasions, unions, and imperial expansion. It began with Roman invasions in 55 and 54 BC, followed by a sustained attempt to conquer Britain in 43 AD under Emperor Claudius. After the Romans, Anglo-Saxon kingdoms emerged, gradually covering present-day England. The Norman Conquest in 1066 marked a significant turning point. England united with Scotland in 1707 to form Great Britain. The 18th and 19th centuries saw the growth of the British Empire, accompanied by the Industrial Revolution.

Charles I called the Parliament to secure funds for his military conflict with Scotland during the Bishops' Wars, but the Parliament focused more on addressing grievances than granting the King funds.

The war resulted in the defeat of the Royalists, the execution of Charles I, and the establishment of the Commonwealth of England, followed by the Protectorate under Oliver Cromwell.

The parliamentarian High Court of Justice declared Charles guilty of attempting to "uphold in himself an unlimited and tyrannical power to rule according to his will" and sentenced him to death.

The execution of Charles I was the culmination of political and military conflicts between the royalists and the parliamentarians in England during the English Civil War.

                  <p class="m-2 text-gray-600">The Stuart Restoration began with Charles II's restoration in 1660, following the Declaration of Breda, and ended with the Glorious Revolution in 1688. The Stuart Restoration marked the return of the monarchy in England after the Commonwealth's collapse.

Charles II's peaceful restoration was secured through his promises of a general pardon, religious toleration, and ruling in conjunction with Parliament.

                  <p class="m-2 text-gray-600">The Glorious Revolution of 1688 was a pivotal event in English history that marked a significant shift towards constitutional monarchy. It led to the overthrow of King James II of England by a union of English Parliamentarians with William III, Prince of Orange.

The Convention Parliament legitimized this power shift by bestowing the crown upon William and Mary, enacting the Bill of Rights that constrained royal authority and affirmed parliamentary power.
