  The history of Great Britain is a tale of invasions, unions, and imperial expansion. It began with Roman invasions in 55 and 54 BC, followed by a sustained attempt to conquer Britain in 43 AD under Emperor Claudius. After the Romans, Anglo-Saxon kingdoms emerged, gradually covering present-day England. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Conquest">Norman Conquest in 1066</a> marked a significant turning point. England united with Scotland in 1707 to form Great Britain. The 18th and 19th centuries saw the growth of the British Empire, accompanied by the Industrial Revolution.
