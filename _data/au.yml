short_history: |
  Austrian history is a complex tapestry of political, cultural, and social evolution. It begins with the ancient Celtic tribes and their influence on the region, followed by Roman rule and later the establishment of the Duchy of Austria in the 12th century. The Habsburgs dominated Austria from the late 13th century, shaping the country into a major imperial power. The Austro-Hungarian Empire was formed in 1867, but it collapsed after World War I, leading to the establishment of the First Republic. The interwar period saw the rise of Austrofascism and the eventual annexation by Nazi Germany in 1938. After World War II, Austria became an independent republic again in 1955 and has since been a neutral country, joining the European Union in 1995.
